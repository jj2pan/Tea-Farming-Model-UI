        - I used the **pandas** and **matplotlib** libraries for EDA.

        The model was trained using a **K Neighbors Regressor**. The performance metrics are as follows:
        - **Mean Absolute Error**: 91.09
        - **Mean Squared Error**: 27861.98
        - **R2 Score**: 0.81

        - Tea processing factories can leverage this model to predict their farmers' harvests. These insights can help them make informed managerial decisions and optimize their operations.
        - Farmer can also use this model to predict their seasonal harvests and plan accordingly.

        - The nature of this dataset and its context leaves a lot of room for further development.
        - I plan to use a weather API to get historical weather data for the region and add it to the dataset.
        - I also want to add lag features to enable the model to learn from previous harvests.
        - These features will add more depth to the data and in combinination with a much more complex model such as a neural network, I believe I can produce much more reliable predictions.
